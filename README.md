# Linux Guides

## About
This is a guide series on how to accomplish switching to Linux, specifically based on Arch. Do not look at this series as a replacement for the Arch Wiki, you should still use the Wiki to make sure you know which packages to install and how to configure specific parameters that my guides might now cover. My guides are more of a fill-in-the-gaps and quick-start set of articles as opposed to explanatory literature.

### News as of 9/5/2022
Well, it's been a long time since I've been here. I took up an engineering position about 6 months back and haven't had time to work on this guide series. This series is no longer for all flavors of Linux, by the way, it's moving completely in the direction of Arch. Many of the guides are still general Linux info.

While a lot of my guides are going to remain valid for many years, but some of my guides are no longer fully working due to changes with some of the packages that are the subject of some guides. If any of my guides don't work for you, please contact me at the email below. I am going to start changing a lot of the information in these guides to keep them up to date.

Lastly, nliaquin.xyz is dead, and nickolasiaquinta@gmail.com is no longer around. The website mostly served as a way for me to demonstrate my skills to potential employers, however, it served me no real use after a while since I already landed a career that I love. That is mainly why I've not been around, because I am passionate about my job. I am still passionate about this series of guides, though, which is why I'm going to start finding the time to return to it. I hope to have most of the information updated and corrected by the end of this month.
