# Linux Guides

## About
Welcome to my series of guides on Linux, specifically centered around the setup and maintenance of Arch Linux. My guides will rely on you specifically using Arch because of what software will be covered being available via the pacman package manager and the AUR (Arch User Repository).

my guides are split up into the following categories:

 - arch-installation, the guides to help you install arch linux
 - software, guides for software available from the pacman package manager or the AUR
 - system-config, guides on how to change settings with the larger environment of your distro or large subsystems of your distro such as Xorg
 - networking, guides on how to configure wifi in Linux with a couple different options of software to choose from
 - gnu, guides for the gnu software that comes with your linux distro, particularly administrative task-focused software


### News as of 10/4/2022
The year is coming to a close and I haven't updated anything in this repo since November 2nd! Time flies by when you have a job. Here's the roadmap for linux-guides before the end of the year:

 - A new layout is going to be introduced soon where all guides are going to be reorganized into directories as opposed to being scattered everywhere. I'm still deciding on the exact style guide, as I don't want people to get confused about where to find specific guides. An update to this README.md file will come out by the end of the day on how the style will be laid out.

 - The arch installation guide will be getting split up into two or three different files and put into their own folder. I recently asked some people who are new to Linux to try out my arch installation guide, and there was some confusion regarding certain segments like preliminaries and grub installation. My goal is to split the EFI and non-EFI versions into two to make things easier.

 - There is going to be some general cleanup of my guides as well. Some of them need some formatting and were just left as is for the longest time. I'd like to thoroughly ensure every guide is up to standard.

Thanks for reading and supporting my guides, please feel free to contact me for help or advice with Linux.
