# Linux Guides

## About
This repository is where I write helpful guides that help people learn how to perform various tasks on Linux without having to read entire wiki pages. I want to provide articles that will help readers accomplish their goals in a reasonable amount of time, but I also don't encourage anyone to treat my guides as a complete replacement for your distro's wiki, or learning linux as a whole in general. Use these guides as a way to start getting things done with Linux and specific utilities mentioned in the articles, but please remember that the wikipedia page for your distro is the best source of information for truly understanding the full picture. Most of the guides are geared towards accomplishing specific tasks that may not be clear when reading a wiki, but once you read some of the guides in this repository, you'll likely have an easier time understanding the wiki pages afterwards. Start here, then head back to the wiki for your distro and go from there.

There is an exception to the above, and that is with a couple articles I've written here so far. It's been a while since I started this repository, and I can say with certainty that my guide on installing Arch contains vast improvements in comparison to the official wiki. You should still read the Arch wiki if you're using Arch, especially for installing and configuring specific programs.

### News as of 1/2/2022
There is now a *drafts* branch for where I publish guides that I'm still working on. This makes it easier for me to work on my guides across devices and give people access to information that, although incomplete, can be helpful.
