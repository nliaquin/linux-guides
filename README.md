# Linux Guides

## About
This repository is where I write helpful guides that help people learn how to perform various tasks on Linux without having to read entire wiki pages. I want to provide articles that will help readers accomplish their goals in a reasonable amount of time, but I also don't encourage anyone to treat my guides as a complete replacement for your distro's wiki, or learning linux as a whole in general. Use these guides as a way to start getting things done with Linux and specific utilities mentioned in the articles, but please remember that the wikipedia page for your distro is the best source of information for truly understanding the full picture. Most of the guides are geared towards accomplishing specific tasks that may not be clear when reading a wiki, but once you read some of the guides in this repository, you'll likely have an easier time understanding the wiki pages afterwards. Start here, then head back to the wiki for your distro, and go from there.

### News as of 9/5/2022
Well, it's been a long time since I've been here. I took up an engineering position about 6 months back and haven't had time to work on this guide series.

While a lot of my guides are going to remain valid for many years, but some of my guides are no longer fully working due to changes with some of the packages that are the subject of some guides. If any of my guides don't work for you, please contact me at the email below. I am going to start changing a lot of the information in these guides to keep them up to date.

Lastly, nliaquin.xyz is dead, and nickolas@nliaquin.xyz is no longer around. The website mostly served as a way for me to demonstrate my skills to potential employers, however, it served me no real use after a while since I already landed a career that I love. That is mainly why I've not been around, because I am passionate about my job. I am still passionate about this series of guides, though, which is why I'm going to start finding the time to return to it. I hope to have most of the information updated and corrected by the end of this month.
