## progress
Progress is a program that allows you to view the status of currently running processes. Primarily used on coreutils programs that terminate on their own when the job that are given comes to its end.

### Usage
If you're moving a large amount of data using the the **mv** command, you can check the progress using the following:
```bash
progress -w
```
This will tell you what the status is on the move, how many bytes are moving, how many bytes have moved, and a percentage of progress completed.

### Installation
Progress is available via all major package managers under the name **progress**.
