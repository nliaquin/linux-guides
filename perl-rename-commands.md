# Using perl-rename
These are some use-cases for perl-rename that come up quite often in my day-to-day Linux administration. If you're managing a server remotely and have a standard format for files and directories, this will help you get started. I will add to this guide over time.

### Installing perl-rename
Every package manager comes with a form of perl-rename and other perl utilities, but depending on the distro, perl-rename may also be referred to as prename or even rename. Please be sure to conduct a search with your package manager before installing:

For Debian-Based Distros
> apt search prename && apt search perl-rename

For Red Hat-Based Distros:
> yum search prename && yum search perl-rename

For Arch-Based Distros
> pacman -Ss perl-rename

After you have read carefully and found the package you're looking for, install like so:

For Debian-Based Distros
> sudo apt install *name_of_package*

For Red Hat-Based Distros:
> sudo yum install *name_of_package*

For Arch-Based Distros
> sudo pacman -S *name_of_package*

### Discretion is Advised
Not all files and directories **should** be renamed. For the most part, the Linux/posix standard has been to keep files and directories lowercase depending on the situation, but a lot of software developers, including myself, have created dependencies on certain files being named a certain way, and renaming them can cause programs to stop working. Always be cautious about what files and directories you rename. Stay out of program directories, Linux filesystem directories, and user program directories when using perl-rename.

### Replace Spaces with Underscores
While there is an escape character for spaces, apostraphes, and other special characters, some such as myself perfer files with underscores and hyphens. I recommend underscores for spaces, and hyphens for tagging content.

In a directory filled with files that have spaces, type the following:
> perl-rename 'y/ /_/' *

If you prefer hyphens instead of underscores altogether:
> perl-rename 'y/ /-/' *

Remember, you can also use these commands on directories. If you wish to target specific files and directories, you can change the astiresk to the name of the file or directory in question:
> perl-rename 'y/ /_/' This\ Is\ An\ Example

### Replace All Uppercase with Lowercase
For files that don't rely on uppercase naming conventions, it's easier to have every file and directory lowercase. When managing a server via SSH, lowercase naming conventions make traversing the filesystem convenient.

For all files in the current directory:
> perl-rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' *

For a specific file or directory:
> perl-rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' specific
